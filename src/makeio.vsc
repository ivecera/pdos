# This makefile builds pload.com for PDOS/386 on Windows,
# using Visual Studio 1.52 plus exe2bin from Open Watcom.

# To produce the 32-bit version, do this:
# pdmake -f makeio.vsc

# Note that it is necessary to add the "noe" linker option
# to stop the extended dictionary from being used and giving
# errors about duplicates. Not sure if there is a better
# way of doing that. Using a library reduces the number of
# object files needed to be specified on the link command,
# as we only need to specify the ones that are involved in
# the self-loading process.

# Use -f to avoid an out of memory error
# If you use -O2 instead of -Ox, you get a smaller executable
# because -Gy seems to be in effect allowing the linker to
# strip unreferenced functions. But it has the side-effect of
# rearranging the order of object files so that they are not
# in the order required for self-loading to complete
